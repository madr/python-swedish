# Python in Swedish
Feel more familiar by writing your Python code in Swedish.

Tested in Python 3.5.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment using virtualenv wrapper (`mkvirtualenv swedish`)
3. Symlink the encoding into the virtualenv (`ln -s $(pwd)/swedish.py ~/.virtualenvs/swedish/lib/python3.5/site-packages/`) and (`ln -s $(pwd)/swedish.pth ~/.virtualenvs/swedish/lib/python3.5/site-packages/`)
4. Run `python main.py` to run python in Swedish, actual code located in `demo.py`
